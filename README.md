# Python-Django-Projects
I have created a repository on GitHub to submit my midterm and final projects on Python (Django). These projects are part of the Digital Skills Training initiative for students, a premier learning opportunity under the EDGE Project by the Bangladesh Computer Council, ICT Division, for the Edge Course (IICT).
